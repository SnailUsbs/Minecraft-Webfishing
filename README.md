# FUTURE UPDATES:
The mod started to corrupt towards the end, and no matter what I tried I couldn't get it to work. It was already finished when the issues started happening I'm going to have to rebuild the mod from scratch for future updates, which will include:

- Custom medium and large private islands
- More fish and loot
- Minecraft sound tracks
- Music box prop to play minecraft tracks
- Nether portal prop
- More props
