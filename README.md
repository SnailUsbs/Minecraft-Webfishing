# Minecraft-Webfishing
A webfishing mod that adds a ton of Minecraft related content into multiple corners of the game.

The file is too big to upload here, so instead you can get it from thunderstore; https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/SnailUSB/Minecraft/

If you want to see the raw files, use GDRE tools to decompile it. Feel free to look into my mod to figure out how to make your own.
